### List of feats

#### Limited Times
* [Amateur Swashbuckler](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/hybrid-classes/swashbuckler) 1 Point a day
  - [Link in github]()
* [Amateur Gunslinger](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/base-classes/gunslinger) 1 Point a day
  - [Link in github]()
* Caster’s Champion: Three times per day as a swift action, when you are within 30 feet of an ally who is an arcane spellcaster, you can channel a portion of her arcane power into your weapons. For 1 round, you gain a +1 bonus on all weapon damage rolls, and your weapons are treated as magic for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. When your base attack bonus reaches +4 and every 4 points thereafter, this bonus increases by 1, to a maximum of +5 at 16th level.

#### Extra Damage
* Bleeding Attack:  When you damage an opponent with an unarmed strike, you deal an extra 1d4 bleed damage.

### To cause effect on enemies
* Blinding Flash: As a move action, you can expertly angle the blade of your weapon or shield to reflect light into an opponent’s eyes, dazzling your foe for 1 round. This feat functions as a gaze attack, and the target must make a Fortitude save (DC 10 + 1/2 your character level + your Dex modifier) to resist the effect. This is a sight-dependent effect, and does not work on creatures that are already blinded or creatures that do not rely on sight as their primary sense. You must be wielding a weapon or shield with a polished or reflective surface in order to use this feat. You must be in an area of bright light to use this feat.

* Fox Style: While using this style, you can use your base attack bonus in place of your ranks in Bluff on Bluff checks to feint in combat and to create a distraction to hide. If your Intelligence is at least 19, you gain a +4 bonus on such Bluff checks when adding your Charisma modifier.

* Scorpion Style: To use this feat, you must make a single unarmed attack as a standard action. If this unarmed attack hits, you deal damage normally, and the target’s base land speed is reduced to 5 feet for a number of rounds equal to your Wisdom modifier unless it makes a Fortitude saving throw (DC 10 + 1/2 your character level + your Wis modifier).

### To defend agains't effects
* Focused Discipline: You gain a +2 bonus on all saving throws against fear effects. Whenever a fear effect targets you and fails to affect you (either because of a successful saving throw or because of immunity to fear), you gain a +2 morale bonus on attack rolls, weapon damage rolls, and CMB checks against the creature that attempted to use the fear affect on you for 1 round.

### In case enemies deal bleed Damage
* Blood Spurt: Whenever a creature adjacent to you hits you with a melee attack that deals bleed damage, that creature must succeed at a Fortitude save (DC = 10 + 1/2 your character level + your Constitution modifier) or become blinded for 1d4 rounds as your blood sprays it in the face. Additionally, if you have a special ability that deals bleed damage (such as a rogue’s bleeding strike rogue talent), as a standard action, you can deal 1 point of bleed damage to yourself to spray blood in the face of an adjacent creature of your choice, causing the same effect. The creature only needs to attempt the saving throw for the first of its attacks that deals bleed damage.

### Use while on concealment
* Blind-Fight: In melee, every time you miss because of concealment (see Combat), you can reroll your miss chance percentile roll one time to see if you actually hit. An invisible attacker gets no advantages related to hitting you in melee. That is, you don’t lose your Dexterity bonus to Armor Class, and the attacker doesn’t get the usual +2 bonus for being invisible. The invisible attacker’s bonuses do still apply for ranged attacks, however. You do not need to make Acrobatics skill checks to move at full speed while blinded.

#### Use in Water
* Aquatic Combatant: You gain a +2 bonus on Swim checks and don’t take the usual penalties on melee attack rolls made underwater. Your slashing melee attacks and unarmed bludgeoning attacks deal full damage underwater.

* River Raiderk: You gain a +2 bonus on Swim and Stealth checks while swimming in calm or rough water (but not while swimming in stormy water). In addition, if you’re able to act in a surprise round and you start the surprise round in water, you can take both a move and a standard action. You still cannot take a full-round action during the surprise round.

### Help teammates
* Archon Style: While using this style, as a move action, you can protect adjacent allies from a single opponent that you currently threaten. This grants adjacent allies a +2 dodge bonus to AC against that opponent’s next melee attack (as long as that attack comes before the beginning of your next turn), but causes you to take a –2 penalty to AC against that opponent until your next turn. The dodge bonus against the designated opponent’s attacks persists even if your allies move away from you.

* Bodyguard: When an adjacent ally is attacked, you may use an attack of opportunity to attempt the aid another action to improve your ally’s AC. You may not use the aid another action to improve your ally’s attack roll with this attack.

### Defensive Purposes
* Armor Focus Select one type of armor, such as chain shirt or splint mail. The AC bonus granted by the selected armor increases by 1.
* Armor Trick: Choose one armor trick option (light, medium, heavy, or shield). You can perform armor tricks in combat when wearing the appropriate armor option.
  - Light:
    - Combat Acrobatics: You have trained yourself to expose only armored sections of your body when performing flips and rolls, leaving you less distracted by concerns about being struck in combat. You are not considered flat-footed when using Acrobatics to move on narrow surfaces and uneven ground without falling, and do not lose your Dexterity bonus to AC while doing so. Additionally, if you use Combat Expertise to increase your AC, the DC for you to use Acrobatics to move through a threatened square at full speed without provoking an attack of opportunity by 10 does not increase.
* Deflect Arrows: You must have at least one hand free (holding nothing) to use this feat. Once per round when you would normally be hit with an attack from a ranged weapon, you may deflect it so that you take no damage from it. You must be aware of the attack and not flat-footed. Attempting to deflect a ranged attack doesn’t count as an action. Unusually massive ranged weapons (such as boulders or ballista bolts) and ranged attacks generated by natural attacks or spell effects can’t be deflected.

### Equipment
* Armor Proficiency, Medium

* Exotic Weapon Proficiency: You make attack rolls with the weapon normally.

* Martial Weapon Proficiency: You make attack rolls with the selected weapon normally (without the non-proficient penalty).

* Sliding Axe Throw: You can choose to take a –2 penalty on a ranged attack roll with an axe, bouncing it or sliding it along the ground. If the target is flat-footed, running, or charging, this attack ignores any bonuses to the target’s AC from its shield. If the attack hits, you may immediately make a trip attempt against the target as a free action. If you fail to trip your opponent, your opponent does not get an attempt to trip you in return. This ability may not work in certain circumstances as determined by the GM, such as if the ground is soft, there is an obstacle or difficult terrain on the floor between you and your target, and so on.

* Weapon Focus: You gain a +1 bonus on all attack rolls you make using the selected weapon.

### To help with skill checks
* Armored Athlete: Choose one Dexterity– or Strength-based skill in which you possess at least 3 ranks. When you attempt a check for the chosen skill, your armor check penalty on that check for wearing light or medium armor is reduced by 3 (to a minimum of 0). If you have 10 or more ranks in the skill, the penalty is instead reduced by 6 (to a minimum of 0). If you have armor training 2 and are proficient with heavy armor, this benefit also applies to armor check penalties for wearing heavy armor.

* Fox Style: While using this style, you can use your base attack bonus in place of your ranks in Bluff on Bluff checks to feint in combat and to create a distraction to hide. If your Intelligence is at least 19, you gain a +4 bonus on such Bluff checks when adding your Charisma modifier.

* Intimidating Prowess: Add your Strength modifier to Intimidate skill checks in addition to your Charisma modifier.

If you hit, you deal damage normally and can make an additional attack (using your full base attack bonus) against a foe that is adjacent to the first and also within reach. You can only make one additional attack per round with this feat. When you use this feat, you take a –2 penalty to your Armor Class until your next turn.

* Improved Drag: You do not provoke an attack of opportunity when performing a drag combat maneuver. In addition, you receive a +2 bonus on checks made to drag a foe. You also receive a +2 bonus to your Combat Maneuver Defense when an opponent tries to drag you.

* Improved Overrun: You do not provoke an attack of opportunity when performing an overrun combat maneuver. In addition, you receive a +2 bonus on checks made to overrun a foe. You also receive a +2 bonus to your Combat Maneuver Defense whenever an opponent tries to overrun you. Targets of your overrun attempt may not chose to avoid you.

* Pushing Assault: When you hit a creature your size or smaller with a two-handed weapon attack modified by the Power Attack feat, you can choose to push the target 5 feet directly away from you instead of dealing the extra damage from Power Attack. If you score a critical hit, you can instead push the target 10 feet directly away from you. This movement does not provoke attacks of opportunities, and the target must end this move in a safe space it can stand in. You choose which effect to apply after the attack roll has been made, but before the damage is rolled.

* Improved Sunder: You do not provoke an attack of opportunity when performing a sunder combat maneuver. In addition, you receive a +2 bonus on checks made to sunder an item. You also receive a +2 bonus to your Combat Maneuver Defense whenever an opponent tries to sunder your gear.
