## Boot Tricks:
In addition to the feat or skill prerequisites for each of these tricks, you must have the Equipment Trick (boots) feat. A pair of boots refers to any set of footwear that has hard soles. These equipment tricks can be used with either magic or mundane boots.

* Cleat Stomp (Improved Unarmed Strike) When you make a successful unarmed strike against an opponent while wearing a pair of boots with cleats, the target takes 1 point of bleed damage. The bleed damage can be stopped by a successful DC 15 Heal skill check or by magical healing. The effects of this trick stack with other sources of bleed damage but not with other bleed damage dealt by this trick.

* Sharp Veer (Combat Reflexes) Whenever you use the charge or run action, you can make one 90-degree turn during your movement. You must move at least 10 feet in a straight line after this turn if you are charging.

## Ladder Tricks:
Ladders are not a common adventuring staple due to their cumbersome size. Yet some adventurers who take ladders with them into the field use them to great effect. In addition to the feat, skill, or other requirements listed for each of these tricks, you must have the Equipment Trick (ladder) feat to use a trick.

* Guarding Ladder (Combat Expertise, Combat Reflexes): You can hold a ladder in one hand and treat it as a heavy wooden shield with the fragile special feature. While holding a ladder, you can use the aid another action (or related abilities, such as the Bodyguard feat) to improve the AC of an ally up to 10 feet away.

## Mirror Tricks:
Adventurers carry mirrors for many unconventional uses. You may perform the following tricks with a mirror or, at the GM’s discretion, with a similarly reflective handheld item, such as a highly polished piece of metal. In addition to the feat, skill, or other requirements listed for each of these tricks, you must have the Equipment Trick (mirror) feat to use a trick.

* Reflect Gaze (Combat Reflexes): As an immediate or swift action, you can use a mirror to reflect a gaze attack. You must either be looking at the creature with the gaze attack or averting your eyes to use this ability, and you must succeed at your saving throw to resist the creature’s gaze attack (if you don’t avoid the need to attempt a saving throw by averting your eyes). If you reflect the creature’s gaze back at it, the creature must succeed at a saving throw to resist its own gaze or lose access to its gaze attack for 1 round. If the creature attempts to gaze at you with its attack action, you may attempt to reflect its gaze back at it, as above, or redirect its gaze to a new target within 30 feet of you. In this case, the new creature is treated as the target of the original gaze (unless it is blindfolded or otherwise unable to see), although it is automatically treated as if it is averting its eyes.

## Pole Tricks:
Each of these tricks can be done with a pole or balancing pole, but specific poles have further abilities. In addition to the feat, skill, or other requirements listed for each of these tricks, you must have the Equipment Trick (pole) feat to use a trick.

* Seek the Unseen (Perception 1 rank): When you attempt to find a creature you cannot see (either because it is invisible, or because you are blind), you can sweep a pole through any two adjacent squares within 10 feet of you as a standard action. Make a melee attack against an AC of 10. If you hit, and if a creature you cannot see is in the designated area, you deal no damage but have successfully pinpointed the creature’s current location.

## Rope Tricks:
In addition to the feat, skill, or other requirement listed for each of these tricks, you must have the Equipment Trick (rope) feat to use rope tricks. Rope tricks can be performed with hemp rope or silk rope, or with similar rope-like items at the GM’s discretion.

* Quick Release (no additional prerequisites): You can secure a rope such that you can loose it from either end by making a quick series of tugs (a move action) at any point along the rope’s length.

## Shield Tricks:
In addition to the feat, skill, or other requirement listed for each of these tricks, you must have the Equipment Trick (shield) feat and proficiency in (non-tower) shields to use a trick. You may use these tricks with any light or heavy shield. At your GM’s discretion, you may be able to use some of these tricks with a tower shield or buckler, but that requires a separate Equipment Trick feat for that kind of shield and may add a penalty on the associated roll.

* Release Shield (no prerequisites): You may remove a light or heavy shield as a swift action instead of a move action. You may remove a throwing shield as a free action. Once you’ve removed the shield, you may hold it in one hand or drop it as a free action.
